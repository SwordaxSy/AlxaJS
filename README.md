## About

AlxaJS is a small lightweight JavaScript library that sums up basic but time-consuming to write tasks in a set of functions grouped in a code file, all you have to do is to include this file in your project directory and you can easily start using the pre-written Alxa functions.

Alxa.js contains a number of useful daily needed functions & methods that can come in handy when working on projects of different sizes and types. Alxa doesn't target a specific type of task or project environment, instead it is multi-task and does many handy things whenever needed.

Getting started with AlxaJS is pretty simple and straight forward, and due to it's small size, including it in your project will consume no space and will cause no performance or speed issues. AlxaJS also provides [documentation](https://alxajs.herokuapp.com/docs) that you can use as a reference to know what you can do with AlxaJS.

## Where did the name Alxa come from?

The name "Alxa" derives from the name of the polymath [Muhammad Ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi), the original inventor of the science of Algorithms, which is widely and mainly used in mathematics, programming, data science, and a lot of other fields. In fact, the word "Algorithm" is as well derived from the name of the great mathematician "Al-Khwarizmi".
